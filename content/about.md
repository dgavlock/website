## Background
I grew up in a small town in central Pennsylvania call Lock Haven! It's a quite little place with beautiful views and a great community of awesome people! Lock Haven has a big place in my heart as it's where I've spent most of my time until now. It's where I met my wife (in high school), then went to college (Lock Haven University), and where I cultivated my love for the outdoors! If you've never been check out the map to get a feel for where it's located!

After completing my degree my wife and I decided to move to Pittsburgh, PA to start our life together and find employment in my field (Biology). After some time I made my way to the University of Pittsburgh, where the Drug Discovery Institute graciously took me in as part of their team as a research technician. It was around this time that I also became interested in statistics and data science, after completing some courses at the Graduate School of Public Health I realized that I really enjoyed coding and learning about computers in general! Now, I've begun to teach myself how to code and have started with data science & web development [**projects**](/projects/)! If you're intested in what I've done you should check them out! I've been fortunate enough to be apart of some awesome biomedical research which you should also check out on my [**resume**](/resume/)!
